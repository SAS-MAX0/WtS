# Word to Story Gen

Word to Story Generator is a webpage where the words typed by the user are converted into individual AI generated stories. The user simply provides a list of words, the tone they would like (horror, funny, sci-fi, etc.), and the number of words they want the story to be, and the A.I. engine of the application combines them into a single short story. A cool feature is available, with optional "Mystery Word" as a way to be more creative when trying to stimulate the imagination.
